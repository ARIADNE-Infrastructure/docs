The Catalogue only contains metadata (or information about the resources), not the actual resource so that the original owner or publisher has full control over their archaeological data. However, the metadata can be very detailed and can include thumbnail images, for example, as well as a link to the actual digital resource (or in a few cases, the shelf number reference to the physical (printed) resource).</p> <p>Each record in the Catalogue is a description of an archaeological resource and contains a number of mandatory fields as well as several optional ones. This structure of the description is a metadata schema, the AOCat, based upon the international CIDOC CRM schema which enables relationships to be described and provides formal definitions for cultural heritage information. It is also quite flexible and so, along with specialised vocabularies, can adapt to different terminologies and concepts used by the many different archaeological domains of interest. ARIADNE has developed some of these specialised vocabularies to cover the few domains where the general archaeological terms do not adequately describe the resources, these generally being for more recently defined specialisms such as remote and near-surface sensing data and ancient DNA. </p> <p>The mandatory fields that must be provided for each metadata record include the title, a description, a resource type and classification, the time period that applies to the resource and a geographical location. These are necessary for the underlying  \u201cWhat\u201d, \u201cWhen\u201d and \u201cWhere\u201d design of the Catalogue. Other mandatory information will include the publisher, the URL (or DOI) for the original resource information (located on the publisher\u2019s server) plus any  information which can be extracted from the supplied information such as the country of the resource. Most records belong to collections, so this relationship is also recorded in the metadata. </p> <p>Each resource owner may have their own classification system \u2013 the terminology can vary widely and can also be in the native language. To ensure that the classification in the ARIADNE Catalogue is uniform and also hierarchical, the Getty Arts and Architecture Thesaurus (Getty AAT) is used to provide the descriptive terms for each resource which allows for efficient and accurate search results. For example, the term \u201cbrooches\u201d belongs to a hierarchy which includes \u201cPins (jewelry)\u201d , \u201cJewelry\u201d and \u201cCostume accessories\u201d above it and has four sub-categories for different types of brooches \u2013 disc, penannular, plaque and ring. Any search will automatically include all records which contain any sub-categories of the specified term. The Getty AAT may also provide more precise categories than the original subject classification and is available in several languages.</p> <p>The geographical location for each resource is recorded as longitude and latitude using the WGS 84 standard. Where the location of a resource is sensitive (e.g. where a valuable artefact has been found or a marine wreck site), the location may be recorded as an area where the actual location is a random point within the boundaries.</p> <p>The time period is a little more complicated since a time period can be indicated by a start and end date or a named period such as \u201cIron Age\u201d or \u201cMedieval\u201d, the issue here being that named periods vary date wise from country to country. The solution is to use PeriodO, a gazetteer of time periods widely used by historians and archaeologists which maps named periods to date ranges across the world, making it possible to search for \u201cBronze Age\u201d across multiple regions, despite the start and end dates varying geographically. </p> <p>Finally, each record with the Catalogue is linked to other records through the concept of Linked Open Data. Linked Data is a set of four design principles that means that data is machine-readable and can be inter-linked over the Web. Linked Open Data is where that data can also be freely used and redistributed as in the ARIADNE Catalogue. In order to make this possible, ARIADNE uses technologies such as RDF triple stores (via GraphDB) which creates a map (graph) of each data record and its connections. As more records are added to the Catalogue, the graph is updated. If a change is made to the AOCat metadata schema, which rarely happens but it usually when a new field is added, then the complete graph is regenerated for the whole Catalogue and this is referred to the ARIADNE Knowledge Graph. When a search is performed, this is done by using a SPARQL query on the Knowledge Graph \u2013 which is a lot faster and much more efficient than processing millions of database records. Another advantage of this approach is that anyone with the right technical knowledge can access and perform their own searches on the Knowledge Graph via the ARIADNEplus Lab. </p>"},{"location":"Portal_User_Guide/Section-1_What/#using-the-ariadne-catalogue","title":"Using the ARIADNE Catalogue","text":"<p>The ARIADNE Portal contains a Catalogue and several services which provide access to over 4 million archaeological resources that can be searched and filtered according to a number of criteria.

In many cases, it is also possible to map the subject matter to the Getty AAT but as this was developed as a more general thesaurus, it doesn\u2019t always contain the level of detail used in archaeology. To mitigate this, the original subject is also included in the search on all fields in the Catalogue and when the Getty AAT filter is used, the results are hierarchical i.e. they match the specified term(s) and all sub-terms.

These may not all be relevant since a description can include the search term as a feature found on an object or on a site. Filters such as the Resource type and Getty AAT Subjects should be used for more targeted searches.</p> </li> <li> <p>The British Museum has supplied over 900,000 resources from the Portable Antiquities Scheme Database of which around half relate to coins and the other half to other types of artefacts which commonly make up \u2018finds\u2019. The coins all have Resource type \u201cCoin\u201d and the artefacts \u201cArtefacts\u201d. On the other hand, the DIME database (published by Aarhus University), which also records finds by the public in Denmark, has allocated Resource type \u201cArtefacts\u201d to all its resources, including coins. This is not wrong, it\u2019s just another way of representing the data. To select all the resources from DIME that are coins, it is necessary to use \u201ccoins\u201d as an initial search term and then filter by Publisher, Aarhus University, as the original subject (usually dime.find.coin) will indicate the type of artefact. The Getty AAT Subject has also been used, some granularity has been applied so five terms are listed of which the most common is \u201cLater western world coins\u201d (a sub-term of Coins (money)). </p> </li> <li> <p>Be aware that not all the resources (approx. 8%) have geographical co-ordinates supplied in their metadata and, where the location of the resource is considered sensitive, a bounding box will be shown containing a random \u2018pin\u2019 to indicate the approximate area. If there is a nearby resource, one pin will be shown \u2013 this can be clicked on to show the corresponding record. Where there are more than one resources nearby, these are shown in series, i.e. one at a time with each successive resource in the same location. This also means that in most cases, when the map filter is applied, the number of resources found will automatically reduce as all those missing location co-ordinates will be excluded from the results. </p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is possible to search the Catalogue using the (modern-day) Country filter, this can be fairly meaningless in the context of archaeology (even more so for marine archaeology!). Recorded place names are included in the metadata. More usefully, the Map allows the selection of areas of interest, including defining an area by drawing a polygon thus enabling borders to be ignored or otherwise. However, it can be useful to define a country, particularly islands or where national boundaries have remained fairly unchanged. One way to do this is through the Publisher filter as many of these providers are the national repository for their archaeological outputs. In many cases, Publishers have provided a Collection record which summarises provided datasets. Alternatively, the When filter can also include regions (within the PeriodO definitions) which may be used for defining areas of interest. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Portal_User_Guide/Section-6_Tips_and_guidance/#working-with-time-periods","title":"Working with time periods","text":"<p>Two approaches have been used to denote time periods \u2013 absolute start and end dates and period names.

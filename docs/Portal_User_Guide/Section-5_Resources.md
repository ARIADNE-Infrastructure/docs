# The Resource page
Clicking on the title of a resource from the Search results page will display the metadata record and all associated information for that resource on a new web page. At the top of the page, the resource’s location is shown on a map where zoom in and out can be done using the ‘+’and ‘-‘ icons on the right hand side. The is also the option to change the layers. Below these icons there is a further rectangular icon which is a pop-up menu with options for changing the size of the dislayed map, these being small (default), medium and full screen.

[This example](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/resource/24d2b18c2f6c0ebe0d3ad5eb5238028efa63d8f03cdd9a7a8c210cd94ae1c1be) is from the DIME database and since it is a find, the location is shown as an approximate area where this particular coin was found. The Geo shape indicates that there is at least one other find nearby and clicking on it will display the relevant record. Multiple finds are displayed in sequence (i.e. click through one at a time) to avoid displaying multiple bounding boxes. The rest of the Resource page is shown below - this collection also has images of the finds so the resource data includes thumbnails pictures.

The map can be enlarged by clicking on the frame icon below the Zoom icons to display the Map size menu as shown here. The size of the map on the resource page  can be increased (and reduced) using the Medium and Full Screen options, the default setting being Small.

## Display of near-by resources on the map

For each record for an individual resource, the map may also display Geo points or shapes for other resources located close by which are included in the returned search results. In the example below, the search term ‘Sword’ was used and this record (published by the National Monuments Service, Republic of Ireland) includes this word in the description of the Chest tomb panel that this record refers to (denoted by Geo shape with the red circle inset). Note that this resource would not be included in the search results if the Getty AAT term filter was used. There are several other sites and monuments of interest in this area, each denoted by a separate Geo shape. Clicking on any of the Geo shapes will display the associated resource.

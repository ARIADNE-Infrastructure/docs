# Time period filter (When)

The When filter consists of three different ways of selecting a time period of interest: a graphic where the mouse is used to select the date range, a text entry box where the start and end year can be specified and a separate filter that uses named time periods as defined in PeriodO.

| The Time line | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![image](../assets/13-Timeline-1.png) | The Time Period graphic (the time line) displays the resources returned in the search results by date distribution.<p><p>The search results can be refined by Clicking on ‘Advanced Search’ to display the Time period filter page (Browse when). <p>If no search term is used or the filter is accessed via the ‘Browse when’ option, then the graph shows the date distribution for the entire catalogue. |
| ![image](../assets/14-Time-line-2.png) | Using the mouse with the Shift key directly on the graphic can be used to define a shorter time period -200-1400 C.E. in this case.<p><p>Scrolling with the mouse will cause the time period graphic to expand. <p>If the mouse is placed closer to the left side, the x-axis will ‘stretch’ from the left (reducing the end date), placed to the right the start date increases (‘stretch’ from the right).|

## Search Filters

In addition to the What, Where and When tools, there are a number of filters that each operate on a specific field in the metadata that can be used to refine the returned search results.

### Resource Type

The Resource type is an ARIADNE concept designed to categorise the resources into general areas of interest to archaeologists and the names are mostly self-explanatory. 

| Resource Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![image](../assets/21-Resource-types.png){ width="350" } | Those Resource types that may need clarification are: <Br><Br>**Fieldwork** – normally a record relating to specific fieldwork e.g. evaluations, interventions, etc. <Br><Br>**Fieldwork report** – these always have a link (URL or DOI) to the actual document.<Br><Br>**Fieldwork archive** – the record refers to a collection of documents, images etc. relating to a site (accessible from the DOI supplied).<Br><Br>**Dating** – datasets using for dating materials e.g. radio carbon and dendrology. |

More than one Resource type can be selected but note that the default operator  on terms is ‘AND’ so this will only result in records being found where all the selected terms have been used. For example, all “Maritime” resources are also classified as Resource type “Site/monument” so combining both Resource types has the same result as selecting just ”Maritime” (this is logical as currently the maritime records relate to ship wrecks). Conversely, Resource type  “Artefacts” and “Coins” have been applied separately and the only record that is returned matching both Resource types is the Collection record for the Portable Antiquities Scheme. In most cases, this filter is useful for excluding records that do not match the specified Resource type.

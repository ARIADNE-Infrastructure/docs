- Fieldwork report – these always have a link (URL or DOI) to the actual document.
- Fieldwork archive – the record refers to a collection of documents, images etc. relating to a site (accessible from the DOI supplied).
- Date – datasets using for dating materials e.g. radio carbon and dendrology. |
